    <p id ="sample-para"> Commenting is one such practice that is often ignored by programmers, especially 
        for codes that are written by multiple programmers. But remember , commenting is
         an important part of project you create . With proper comments and organised files 
         is always easier for you or others to jump in and understand where things are at 
         and how they work.
